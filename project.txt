 PsuedoCode
 **
 1) Made 5 fucntions(add,edit,remove,hi to low, and low to high)
    this is a template to work on we can change later...
 2) Decide who would work on what function or we could work on it together and go step by step so we both understand what is going on in each fucntion
 3) Start a build Phase and work on each fucntion adding pieces and making sure they work
 4) Make sure we arent leaking memory
 5) Test Phase we should test each function seperatly and then run each funcition one after another
 6) End

 *1/14/2022
 What SPECIFIC task will you complete in the next half hour?
 1)The specific task that I will complete today is start a psuedo code and send to tyler
 What do you know about this SPECIFIC task?
 2)I know how to build a psuedo code
 What DON'T you know about this SPECIFIC task?
 3)I am not entirely sure where to start building the psuedo code

 *1/16/2022
 What SPECIFIC task will you complete in the next half hour?
 1)The specific Task that I want to work on is making sure we have a structure to lay out
 What do you know about this SPECIFIC task?
 2)We know what functions we are going to work with
 What DON'T you know about this SPECIFIC task?
 3)We dont know how each function is going to work yet

 *1/18/2022
 What SPECIFIC task will you complete in the next half hour?
 1)The specific task I will complete today is I am going to work on the add and edit function
 What do you know about this SPECIFIC task?
 2)I know that I am going to have to alter the array the stocks are beign held in
 What DON'T you know about this SPECIFIC task?
 3)I dont know just yet how to alter the array

 *1/21/2022
 What SPECIFIC task will you complete in the next half hour?
 1)The specific task I will complete today is test each function with tyler and go through code making sure we both understand it
 What do you know about this SPECIFIC task?
 2)I Know me and tyler are going to have to test each function
 What DON'T you know about this SPECIFIC task?
 3)I dont know which functions are going to have trouble or not

Agile Questions- Tyler

1/14/2022
1)We set out to build an idea of the different functions that this project would
require. We did this by writing psuedo code.
2)We know that this project is going to require arrays, user input, and the use of
pointers and references.
3)We don't know exactly how all the pieces are going to fit together at the moment.

1/16/2022
1)We will determine a display and process menu for control of the program.
2)We know what the individual functions will need to accomplish.
3)The specifics of each function are to be determined.

1/18/2022
1)The specific work I will working on right now is the sorting functions.
2)I know that I will be sorting an array based on a float value from high to low and from low to high.
3)I don't know how to copy and return arrays using pointers.

1/21/2022
1) Today Freddy and I will be testing the program using different methods.
2) We know that we will be testing edge cases and potential user errors that
might occur.
3)We don't know what bugs(if any) will present themselves.
